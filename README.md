# CPE112 Final Project

## Introduction
For the final project, you will be working in a group of 5 members. The objective of the project is to compare 5 different sorting algorithms based on their time taken and memory usage. You will be using various test cases, such as the number of data, input order, and repetition, to evaluate the performance of each sorting algorithm.

## Sorting Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms will be compared in this project:
1. Algorithm 1
2. Algorithm 2
3. Algorithm 3
4. Algorithm 4
5. Algorithm 5

## Methodology
1. Implement each sorting algorithm in your preferred programming language.
2. Design test cases with different characteristics, such as varying data sizes, different input orders, and repetitions.
3. Measure the time taken and memory usage for each sorting algorithm using the test cases.
4. Record the results for further analysis.

## Report
Once you have collected the data, you will create a report using LaTeX. The report should include the following sections:
1. Introduction: Briefly explain the purpose of the project and the sorting algorithms being compared.
2. Methodology: Describe the steps you followed to conduct the experiments and collect the data.
3. Results: Present the results of the experiments, including the time taken and memory usage for each sorting algorithm.
4. Analysis: Compare the performance of each sorting algorithm based on the results obtained. Provide supporting reasons for your comparisons.
5. Conclusion: Summarize the findings of the project and any insights gained from the analysis.

## Conclusion
By comparing the performance of different sorting algorithms, this project aims to provide insights into their efficiency under various test cases. The report generated using LaTeX will help in presenting the results and analysis in a structured manner.

Good luck with your project!
